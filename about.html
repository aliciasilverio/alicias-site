      <p>My passion for coding began with my love for video games. The first game I ever played was the original "God of War," and it sparked my curiosity about the technology and mechanics behind these virtual experiences. I spent countless hours exploring and experimenting with different programming languages, and I found that I had a natural talent for coding.</p>

        <p>As a result, I decided to pursue a career in web development, where I could combine my passion for creating and my love of coding. I have honed my skills in JavaScript, as well as other languages such as Python, and I am currently in the process of learning Typescript to further expand my abilities.</p>
        
    </p>In addition to my passion for coding, I also love to travel and explore new places. I believe that traveling broadens the mind and helps us see the world from different perspectives. I have had the opportunity to visit many amazing places and have experienced a wide range of cultures and traditions.</p>
        
        I am also passionate about music and enjoy both listening to and creating my own tunes. I find that music is a great way to relax and express myself, and I often use it as a source of inspiration for my coding projects.
        
        <p>Overall, my interests in coding, traveling, and music have shaped who I am as a person and as a professional. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow and learn, and I am excited to see where my interests will take me next.</p>
